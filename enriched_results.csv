Hi Nan,

I noticed Pacific Coast Food Distributors' commitment to providing quality office furniture to businesses in the Pacific Northwest, California, and the Southwest. As a leading wholesaler, have you considered enhancing your clients' workspace with our innovative snacks?

Happy Global offers CRISUP potato sticks and KOZED peelable halal gummies, perfect for break rooms and office meetings. With free shipping on orders over 70 cases and a sample case available on request, now is the perfect time to try our products. Could you provide your preferred ship-to address or schedule a quick call to discuss further?

Looking forward to potentially partnering with Pacific Coast Food Distributors.

Best regards,
